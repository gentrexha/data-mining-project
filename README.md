# KushMaAktiv

A full-stack web application for scraping, analyzing, and visualizing political data from Facebook. 

This new project is based on the old project: https://bitbucket.org/gentrexha/dataminingproject/src/master/

## Getting started

## Scraping

Currently there's two different methods for scraping data from Facebook pages.

### manual-scraper.py

Note: uses selenium, but I've changed the script to work for our use-case.
